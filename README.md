PROJECT ANALYSIS, INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE: 

For my project, I’ve set up the webpage so it flows nicely and makes it super easy for anyone visiting to find what they're looking for. It’s a one-page design where everything is divided into simple sections:

Header: Up top, there’s a profile photo (so people know who they’re reading about!) and a navigation bar with links to different parts of the page. So if someone wants to learn more about my experience or skip straight to my skills, they just need to click.

"About Me": This section is all about me—who I am, what I’m into, and what drives me as a computer engineering student. It’s a little intro to give visitors a sense of who they’re dealing with.

"Skills and Languages": Here, I list the programming languages I know (with little icons to make it look cool) and my language skills, ranked by how fluent I am. Basically, it’s a quick “here’s what I can do” section.

"Experience": This part talks about my work experience, like my stints at SPAR and Mooma. I mention what I did, what I learned, and anything interesting I picked up on the job.

"Education": This is where I highlight my studies, focusing on my computer engineering degree from the University of Girona (UDG). Nothing too fancy—just the essentials.

"Portfolio": I’ve got a couple of projects here to show what I’ve been working on. It’s a mix of simple stuff, but it shows what I can do and how I apply my skills.

"Contact": Finally, there’s a section where people can get in touch—email and phone number, both clickable to make it easy.

Each part stands out on its own but fits together to keep things looking clean and easy to navigate. There are flip-cards to keep things interactive and add a bit of fun.


PROJECT ANALYSIS, VISUAL DESIGN:

When I worked on the visual design of my webpage, my main goal was to make it look clean, engaging, and a little bit unique. I chose a warm, light brown background to give the page a welcoming and relaxed feel. To create contrast, I used a darker brown for the headers and important elements, making sure everything stands out but still looks well put together.

I wanted the content to be more interactive, so I used flip-cards for each main section. This way, when users hover over a card, it flips and shows more details. It makes the page more dynamic and interesting, showing that I can create interactive elements. It also breaks the monotony of just scrolling through plain text.

For the text, I kept things simple and readable. I used a clean sans-serif font and made the text a bit larger so it’s easy on the eyes. The section titles are in bold to grab attention and make it clear what each section is about.

To make things look cooler and more visually appealing, I added icons for the programming languages I know. This way, people can quickly recognize my skills at a glance. I also added a hover effect to the navigation links so that they change color when you move the mouse over them, making it clear that they’re clickable.

Overall, the design is meant to be simple, clear, and a bit playful to show my personality while staying professional.
